# UI Design Research Notes - Minimalist Apps

## Notion Design Principles

### Core Philosophy
- **Block-based system**: Everything is a transformable block (text, embeds, databases, media)
- **Progressive disclosure**: Advanced features reveal only when needed
- **Minimalism**: Clean canvas, consistent typography, spacing, interaction patterns
- **Empowerment over prescription**: Users architect their own workflows

### Key UX Patterns
1. **Slash commands**: Contextual power without cluttering UI
2. **Drag handles**: Appear on hover, keep canvas clean
3. **Subtle animations**: Guide interactions without distraction
4. **Infinite nesting**: Pages within pages, unlimited depth
5. **Dynamic views**: Same data, different presentations (timeline, board, list)

### Visual Design Elements
- Clean, uncluttered interface
- Consistent typography system
- Generous whitespace
- Contextual UI elements (appear when needed)
- Soft, muted color palette
- Focus on content, not chrome

### Cognitive Load Reduction
- Hide complexity behind simple interactions
- Progressive feature discovery
- Templates for quick starts
- Inline editing (no mode switching)
