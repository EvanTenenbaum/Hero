## What Worked Well

Nothing worked well as the application failed to load.

## What Needs Improvement

The application needs to be fixed to be accessible. The critical loading error prevents any testing from being performed.

## Recommendations

Prioritize fixing the critical loading error (BUG-CHAT-1) to enable any further testing or use of the application.

## Testing Notes

Testing was blocked due to the application being inaccessible. The initial page load resulted in a critical error, preventing any features from being tested.
