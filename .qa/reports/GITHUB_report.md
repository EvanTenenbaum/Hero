> 
> ## What Worked Well

> Nothing worked well as the application failed to load.
> 
> ## What Needs Improvement
> 
> The application needs to be stable and load correctly before any features can be tested.
> 
> ## Recommendations
> 
> The critical bug BUG-GITHUB-1 must be fixed before any further testing can be performed.
> 
> ## Testing Notes
> 
> The application is completely inaccessible due to a critical error on page load. This prevented any testing of the assigned domain. The error message suggests a problem with URL construction in the application's JavaScript code.
