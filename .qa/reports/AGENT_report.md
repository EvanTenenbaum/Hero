| BUG-AGENT-1 | Critical | Application Fails to Load |

## What Worked Well

- N/A

## What Needs Improvement

- The application is completely inaccessible, preventing any testing from being performed.

## Recommendations

- The critical loading bug (BUG-AGENT-1) must be addressed immediately. This is a blocking issue that prevents any further testing or use of the application.

## Testing Notes

- I was unable to test the assigned domain (Agent Execution & Management) due to the critical application loading failure.
